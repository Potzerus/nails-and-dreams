General game where you type in step combos to perform dances and channel them into attacks

concept:

you generate dungeon keys by dreaming, you can unite shards with others to spawn bigger dungeons to clear but theres a required resource to manifest shards, natural dungeons also spawn randomly and disappear on clear or after a set amount of time(which is displayed)

as an example youd type in something like:

dungeons

-----------------------
| 1: Cacophany of Screams(3h 24m 6s remaining)|
-----------------------

dungeon enter 1

> Entering Cacophany of Screams...

>Room 1 
Slime lvl 1

dance cccs

> you charge [Nail] 
> slime convulses

> you charge [Nail]
> slime convulses

> you charge [Nail]
> slime explodes out, splashing bits of itself on you
> you take 3 damage

> you slash with [Nail]
> charge 3x base damage 3 
> you hit the slime for 9 damage
> slime is [bloodied]
